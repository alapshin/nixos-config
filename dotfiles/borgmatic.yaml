location:
  # List of source directories to backup (required). Globs and
  # tildes are expanded. Do not backslash spaces in path names.
  source_directories:
    - /home/alapshin/calibre
    - /home/alapshin/Documents
    - /home/alapshin/Pictues
    - /home/alapshin/Videos
    - /home/alapshin/Syncthing
  # Paths to local or remote repositories (required). Tildes are
  # expanded. Multiple repositories are backed up to in
  # sequence. Borg placeholders can be used. See the output of
  # "borg help placeholders" for details. See ssh_command for
  # SSH options like identity file or port. If systemd service
  # is used, then add local repository paths in the systemd
  # service file to the ReadWritePaths list.
  repositories:
    - rm4i22x5@rm4i22x5.repo.borgbase.com:repo
# Retention policy for how many backups to keep in each category. See
# https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/prune.html for
# details. At least one of the "keep" options is required for pruning
# to work. To skip pruning entirely, run "borgmatic create" or "check"
# without the "prune" action. See borgmatic documentation for details.
retention:
  keep_daily: 7
  keep_weekly: 4
  keep_monthly: 1
# Repository storage options. See

storage:
  # Command to use instead of "ssh". This can be used to specify
  # ssh options.  Defaults to not set.
  ssh_command: ssh -i /run/secrets/borg/borgbase_ed25519
  # Path for Borg encryption key files. Defaults to
  # $borg_base_directory/.config/borg/keys
  borg_keys_directory: /run/secrets/borg/keys
  # The standard output of this command is used to unlock the
  # encryption key. Only use on repositories that were
  # initialized with passcommand/repokey/keyfile encryption.
  # Note that if both encryption_passcommand and
  # encryption_passphrase are set, then encryption_passphrase
  # takes precedence. Defaults to not set.
  encryption_passcommand: cat /run/secrets/borg/encryption_passphrase
